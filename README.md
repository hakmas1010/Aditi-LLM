# Aditi-LLM

## 🌍 Problem
Most chatbots and AI assistants feel **robotic, unnatural, and limited** in conversation. Users often get frustrated because AI **fails to understand context, emotions, or subtle cues**, making interactions less helpful and less human-like.

- Adaptive responses that **feel personal and intuitive**  
- A model capable of **learning from interactions**, improving over time

Aditi provides an AI that doesn’t just respond, but **communicates naturally**, making users feel understood.
